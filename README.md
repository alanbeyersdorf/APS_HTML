Folium map with incoming letters to Philadelphia 1748-1752

Historic Postal Data - Incoming.csv is the data source from the American Philosophical Society
postal_incoming_map.py is the active python file I'm working on
Historic_Philadelphia_Incoming_Post.html is produced through folium in the .py file

Intention:
  Build Interactive map with time slider to see both Philadelphia incoming and outgoing letters and corresponding cities
  
 To-Do:
  --Create indiviudal "letters" for each week mail is sent
  --Animate letters from one location to the other
  --Create time-based Play button and interactive slider to see letters moving over time
  --UI lock in Folium to expand or contract with limits, depending on how much map is shown
